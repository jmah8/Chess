Chess game

Simple chess game with possible move showed in yellow, when a piece is pressed.
Also shows when a piece is checking a king by highlighting it in red.
Clicking a piece makes every other piece unclickable except for the possible moves.
Reclicking the same piece allows for the player to go back to choosing which piece to move.
